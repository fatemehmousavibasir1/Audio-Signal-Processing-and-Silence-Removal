Audio Signal Processing and Silence Removal
Overview
This project focuses on audio signal processing techniques, particularly on removing silent segments and performing spectral analysis. It processes audio signals to enhance their useful content and extract meaningful frequency features.

Features
1. Silence Removal from Audio Signals:
Silence removal can help reduce the data volume and eliminate unnecessary sections of the audio. In this code, silence is removed by setting a threshold for the signalâ€™s intensity (e.g., threshold set to 1000). Parts of the signal with low intensity (considered silence) are discarded. This step improves the efficiency of subsequent analyses by keeping only the sections of the signal that contain meaningful information.

2. Spectral Analysis of the Signal (FFT):
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze the different frequency components of an audio signal. It allows us to identify which frequencies carry the most energy. In the code, fft_result is used to identify the spectral peaks and extract the corresponding frequencies. This is useful for identifying important audio features, such as intervals between peaks, which can reveal information about the sound characteristics.

3. Formant Frequency Detection:
Formants are specific frequency bands that carry more energy in human speech. To detect formants, spectral analysis and algorithms like LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) are often used. The code here likely includes such methods to identify the prominent formant frequencies in the audio signal.

4. Naming the Audio Processing Processes:
For the processes of silence removal and spectral analysis of audio signals, you could use names that reflect the tasks performed. I would suggest names like "Audio Signal Enhancement" or "Silent Segment Removal and Spectrum Analysis". These names clearly describe the actions taken (enhancing the signal and analyzing its frequency content).
